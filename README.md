# CoMotion

The goal of this application is to record, edit, save, and export Core Motion data.

Recorded data can be viewed in a list or chart.

![Example Line Chart](https://github.com/kylesyoon/CoMotion/blob/master/etc/line.png?raw=true)

I'm trying out the [VIPER architecture](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/). 

Package Manager is [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). The only 3rd party dependency is [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts).
